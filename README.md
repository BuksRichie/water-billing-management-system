## Title
Homeowners Association Water Billing and Collection Management System

## Details
The proposed system is a C# Windows Application. The purpose of the project is to enable the association to acquire better management in water billing. Aside from water billing, the project will include monthly collection for improved monitoring of the residents' payments and establish harmony in transactions. The system will have authorized user accounts and features that can accomplish transactions such as creating paper and paperless billing that includes water meter reading and monthly collection, email or short messaging services for notification, and resident management. The authorized user shall update monthly water meter reading each residents’ water consumption and monitor possible unpaid water bills or monthly collection. Monthly water bills will be computed according to water meter consumption rates along with the monthly association dues. There are times the homeowners or residents may not receive their bill notice resulting to delayed payment and disconnection. Hence, with this project, residents will receive billing through email or short messaging service to stay up to date. Authorized users will be able to manage customer or resident list. Records will include the head of residents’ full name, email address or mobile number, residents’ block and lot, monthly water meter consumption including previous reading and current reading, and monthly association dues. The authority shall also update residents’ accounts as paid, unpaid and to be disconnected if dues are failed to pay.
